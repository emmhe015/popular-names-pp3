# Top 3 most popular names
### A survey to find out the amount of children being named each name in the last three years.

## Content
- The content is created with a while loop which allows the user to enter more than one name without having to restart the program. 
- Depending on which name the user inserts, the result is variable. The result is taken from a google worksheets.
- If the user prints a wrong name, an error message appears. 
- If the user input is Stop, the program stops running. 

## Testing and Validating
- I have failed some times, with keeping the functions nested in the right scope. I got ChatGPT to help me get it straight. 
- In **PEP8** there are a few errors showing, with whitelines and too long messages. I choose to go ahead with the whitelines in order to have a readable code. 
- I tested the program after deployment, with no errors running. 

## Deployment
This deployment was deployed using the Code institutes mock terminal for Heroku.
- Steps for deployment
  - Fork or clone this repository
  - Create a new heroku app
  - Set the buildpacks to python and node.js in that order 
  - Link the heroku app to the repository
  - Click on deploy

  ## Credits
  - Code institute for the deployment terminal and the using of worksheets in this project.
  - Due to limited of time, this is a very simple project in python. If I had more time, it would have been more complicated with more functions.
